## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
The thing that I learn the most from this project is how to center a container. Below is the code that I think that does it.

```html
<div id="qrcode-container"></div>
```
```css
#qrcode-container {
    margin: 100px auto;
    max-width: 100%;
    max-height: 100%;
    overflow: auto;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

There are still many things that are unclear to me now. One of them is how to control the position of a container inside of another container. Another area that I want to learn is about responsive web design.
